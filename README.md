Project Proposal 

1. The Big Idea: 
What is the main idea of your project? 
What topics will you explore and what will you generate? 
What is your minimum viable product? 
What is a stretch goal?

	The main idea of our project is to create a fun, entertaining, and engaging game. This game draws on ideas of other games while incorporating new and exciting themes. This game will feature the player in a city location. The player has to make it to “work” or “school” within a given amount of time, depending on the difficulty of the level. There will be multiple levels to  “maps”. For example, if the player is trying to make it to work, the levels, escalating from easiest to hardest, include: getting to public transportation, getting to the specific train, walking on a few sidewalks, and crossing a few roads.   However, the player will encounter and overcome obstacles frequently faced in cities such as crowds, cars/bikes, different types of people, and construction. If the player fails to reach their destination in time or fails to overcome an obstacle the game will be over. Attached are wireframes further explaining the concept behind this game. 
	Topics to explore outside of coding include common obstacles faced in cities that are able to be incorporated into this game. Furthermore, researching similar games with similar themes will be useful to incorporate key features. For example, games such as CrossyRoads, Subway Surfers and Temple Run include the objective of avoiding obstacles. Games such as Candy Crush include timed and “map” aspects. 
	Given the time constraints of the semester, features will need to be prioritized. Each feature incorporated should be refined as much as possible. The goal is quality over quantity of features. Our minimum viable product is a functioning game that has our required features with no bugs. Our required features include a character/player going through the city and avoiding obstacles. Our stretch goal is to add all of the details we initially thought of, such as everything we will see in the city. 

2. Learning Goals: 
Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

    Tarika’s Learning Goals
        Learning to code beyond this class and be able to understand how to do the basic functions in python
        Create a game that people will enjoy playing
    Regine’s Learning Goals
        Code a game similar to my favorite games
    Lauren’s Learning Goals
        Creating a both engaging and graphically appealing game. Being able to code similar ideas with pygame after this project. 
        Create and stick to a style guide throughout the project
    Group Learning Goals
        Learning the dynamics within group coding


3. Implementation Plan: 
This will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

    Practice playing simple games that are similar to our planned game
    Notice similarities between games
    Look into game reviews for suggestions and what  to look out for
    Familiarize ourselves with coding within Pygame
    Creating a style guide and name for the game early on so as to not slow progress during other task

4. Project schedule: 

    Week
    Tasks
    1
        Individual Game Research
        Prepare for next week’s tasks
    2
        Collaboration on research findings/debate on main features
        Head start on design research
    3
        Design Research - simple Style Guide
        Come up with favored features individually
    4
        Finalize features/initial coding/Wireframes
        Prepare for next week’s tasks
    5

        Sprint 3 - user testing (part 2)
        Edit
    8
        Sprint 4 - final modifications
        More user testing



5. Collaboration plan: 
How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? 
Weekly 
If needed, meet 2-3 week
Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? 
    Research will be individual 
    Next few tasks will be both independent & integrated 
    Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure. 
    More simple work - individual 
    Once ideas are finalized, more integration 
    Going back and forth with individual work and group work

6. Risks: 
    What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?
    Making it more complicated than it should be
    Trying to include too much 
    Time constraints

7. Additional Course Content: 
    What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?
    Random function
    Class on Pygame
    More advanced graphic user interface
